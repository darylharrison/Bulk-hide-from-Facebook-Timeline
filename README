This is a userscript that I quickly hacked together to bulk hide activities from Facebook Timeline.

The script adds a link "Hide all activity from this section" for each month in the Activity Log. When you click on this link it will hide all activity for that month.

You will need to use Firefox with the Greasemonkey extension and then visit the following URL to install:

Please feel free to improve it as you see fit :)
